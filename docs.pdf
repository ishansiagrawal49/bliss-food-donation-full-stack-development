Most of the food we waste is, in fact, fit for human consumption. Indians waste as much food as the whole of United
Kingdom consumes. Supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, our homes, farms are dumping out a large amount of food.
These food items are then locked in a truck and dumped in landfills. Surely, we can do more sensible to food than to
waste it.

world.
Weddings, canteens, hotels, social and family functions, households throw out so much food. One such colossal waste is
discarding food which is edible because they are of wrong shape or size. Ex: Potatoes that are of wrong shape or size or
oranges that have a spot on its peel are discarded by the supermarkets and it goes into bins.
AccordingtotheUnitedNationsDevelopmentProgramme,upto40%ofthefoodproducedinIndiaiswasted. Thisincludes
farm waste, transportation waste, household level, waste from supermarkets due to the wrong shape, size etc.
You know India is the second largest producer of food crops but it’s highly ironical that the largest hunger population
resides in India. About 7 million children died in 2015 because of hunger/malnutrition. 20 crore Indians sleep hungry on
any given night.
India is home to the largest undernourished population in the world. About 14.5% of our population is undernourished.
1 in every 4 children is malnourished. 3000 children in India die every day from diet-related issues. Hunger remains the
number one cause of death not only in India but the entire world. AIDS, cancer etc. follows.
So, we are observing that on one hand there is a large amount of food being wasted but on the other hand, there are
millions who die every year due to hunger.

TISBEINGDONE?
There are a large number of NGOs working in this field by collecting the excess food from marriages, functions, public
gatherings or individuals who have excess food and are distributing it to the poor or orphanages and old age homes.
Let me ask you a question how many NGOs do you know in your area who do such a thing and how can you contact them?
Maybe you know a few of them or not a single one. So, I will give you a list of food charities, NGOs and will also show you
what is the problem.
There are many more organizations which can be contacted on their telephone numbers. Some of them have their web-
sites as well but we don’t even know their names so how can we contact them?

TDOWEPROPOSE?
You all must have heard of Trivago. It is not a hotel website but a website that searches for a hotel in a particular area and
compares them and helps you contact them without taking much pain.
Our website is quite similar. If you want to donate you don’t have to search for an NGO in your area and then contact them.
We will do all that for you. You just have to visit our website and pick a date and time and if you wish you can see the NGOs
active in your area and choose your preferred NGO.

An organization which wishes to accept donation requests and distributes it registers itself on our website. In this step,
they provide their address and other contact details.
This way we have a network of organizations.
Nowanyonerangingfromrestaurants, supermarkets, andothercommonpeoplecanmakedonationrequests. Theyspec-
ify their address. We calculate the distance and time required between user’s location and all the registered organizations
in the city and sort them according to the distance. With this, we also show the location of both user and NGO on a map.
Here the user can select his/her preferred organization. Once the user selects an organization, the NGO gets a notification
to either accept it or reject it. If the NGO excepts it, the work is done and both user and NGO receive a mail regarding each
other’s contact details. If the NGO declines it, the request made by the user is treated as a floating one.
Now through the services portal specifically created by us for the organizations, NGOs can select the user according to its
convenience. This way we are ensuring higher chances for the donation request to be successful.

Registration
:
New NGOs will provide their e-mail ID on which an OTP will be sent to verify credibility*- of the e-mail ID and also e-mail
will be searched in the database to restrict multiple registrations on our website through same e-mail ID.
Oncethee-mailhasbeenverifiedtheuserwillberedirectedtotheregistrationpageonwhichhecanprovidedetailsabout
his organization. Then the data provided by the user is verified through PHP (with the help of regex) for mistakes (like the
phone number is of 10 digits, the password should be strong, the address should be valid etc.) From a security point of
view, the registration page can’t be opened directly without going through the e-mail verification stage. If anyone tries to
open the registration page directly then he/she will be redirected to the e-mail verification page.
MANAGE YOUR ACCOUNT
:
The user will be redirected to a login page where he can log in by providing his registered e-mail and password. For in-
creased security captcha is also included. If the password matches the user is redirected to a management portal. Again,
the portal can’t be opened directly without going through the login page.
Forgot password: On the login, page user can find a link to forget password page. On clicking it a new page opens which
demands registered e-mail ID of the user. If the e-mail ID is registered in our database then a temporary password is sent
to the user e-mail ID.
NGO Portal provides three services
:
1. Pending/ Confirmed Requests- Here the registered NGOs can see the pending requests of the donors who choose that
NGO as their preferred NGO and can confirm or reject the request.
Also, all the accepted requests by the NGO is displayed in another section of the page along with the details of the user.
2. Floating Requests- In this section, all the requests which are rejected by the preferred NGO of the user is displayed and
are open to all NGO to get confirmed thus increasing the chances of the food to be utilized.
3. Update Information- For organizations that wish to update their information in our database.
